# ET3240_LCD
On screen multimeter using python and tkinter
Simple interface shows units that I need. DCV, RES, if you need more, drop issue and I will add more.

Uses SCPI command set, there is no documents on this so I had to do some reverse engineering and found some commands that works.

Right now there is no GUI for selecting port, but As I don't need it, I didin't bothered to implement one. Will in the future.
